        if
        you have instructed your mobile device or computer to send such information via the privacy settings on that

        with
        relevant content and contextual advertising.</p>
    <p><br><br></p>
    <p><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HOW WE GATHER INFORMATION FROM USERS?</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>How we collect and store information depends on the pages you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to
        participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register
        for
        access to certain portions of our Mobile App, create a User account, request certain features, such as e-mail
        newsletters or when you make a payment. Like most Mobile Apps,&nbsp;Emergency Notifier&nbsp;also collects
        information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors and
        Users.
        For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Like other Mobile Apps, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualised content. We
        respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone, except in cases when that proves necessary.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We will retain the information we collect from you for a period of maximum of 5 /five/ years, or less if it is no
        longer necessary for the provision of the services to you. After the expiry of this period we undertake to
        delete
        any information we have collected from you.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Aggregate information and information that does not personally identify you, may be used in many ways. For
        example,
        Emergency Notifier may combine information about your usage patterns on the Mobile App with similar information
        obtained from other users to help enhance our site and Services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited the most
        or
        what features Users find the most attractive). This information does not include any information about you and
        does
        not allow anyone to identify you individually. We may use personally identifiable information, collected on the
        Mobile App, to communicate with you about your registration and customisation preferences; our Terms of Service
        and
        Privacy Policy; services and products offered by or through the Mobile App; and other topics we think you might
        find
        of interest. Personally identifiable information collected by Emergency Notifier may also be used for other
        purposes, including but not limited to Mobile App administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
        transactions and other communications with you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br><br></p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <strong>DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Emergency Notifier won&apos;t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or
        facilitating third-party advertising to you. We won&apos;t sell information about you. We may share your account
        information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service
        provider or
        partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law,
        such as
        pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (4) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help
        prevent
        imminent harm to someone. If we are going to share your information in response to legal process, we&apos;ll
        give
        you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we&apos;re prohibited by
        law
        or believe doing so may endanger others. We will object to requests for information about users of our services
        that
        we believe are improper. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our Mobile App
        -
        our hosting service for example - may have access to such information.</p>

    <p>Your personal data safety is of utmost importance to us. We review and strive to improve our security measures on
        a
        regular basis.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If we detect a breach of our security measures, which has the potential of harming you as individual we will
        notify
        you without undue delay.</p>
    <p><br><br></p>
    <p><strong>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
